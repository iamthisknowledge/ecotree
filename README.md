## Overview

### The goal

I AM:

- [x] able CSS concepts like padding and margin.
- [x] to organise a Webpage with HTML5 structure and by using <header> <main> and <footer>.
- [x] appreciative to be dedicated in learning how to make websites.
- [x] able to do it now and ever.
- [x] grateful to practise enough.
- [x] found to make my own projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

- I learned how to use HTML and CSS with great practises.

### Continued development

I love to have this knowledge while also being in this ever evolving process of learning more and more HTML and CSS.
